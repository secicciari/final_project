# Green Team Final Project

## Project Topic
Where are the best wines coming from - based on Wine Enthusiast reviews and weather data. Can we predict where future great wines will come from?

## Communication Protocols
Our main tool for communicating as a group will be Slack. To get in contact urgently we exchanged phone numbers and emails.
